Some different ways to improve the RNN model:

1. Getting more training data: model is trained on 5 years of the Google stock price date (the past), but it would be even better to train it on the past 10 years.

2. Increasing the number of timesteps: the model remembered the stock prices from the 60 previous financial days to predict the stock price of the next day. Thatâ€™s because number of 60 timesteps (3 months) is chosen. Could try to increase the number of timesteps, by choosing for example 120 timesteps (6 months).

3. Adding some other indicators: if the stock price of some other companies might be correlated to Googles stock price, could try and add this other stock price as a new indicator in the training data.

4. Adding more LSTM layers: RNN was built with four LSTM layers, but could try with even more.

5. Adding more neurones in the LSTM layers: the fact that a high number of neurones is required in the LSTM layers to respond better to the complexity of the problem is highlighted, and 50 neurones are included in each of the 4 LSTM layers. Could try an architecture with even more neurones in each of the 4 (or more) LSTM layers.
